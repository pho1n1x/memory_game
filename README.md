# About this repository
This is a little ruby code challenge I had to do for a job application. It is not exactly the same program I submitted, because I really messed up the code challenge. The fact that I blew the challenge bothered me so much, that I couldn't sleep until I properly redid it and made it work. In fact it was a fairly simple challenge and I couldn't deliver properly. -.-

Tl;dr I messed up a code challenge and wanted to redeem myself. ^^

# About the Memory Game
It's a simple memory game. The program creates 20 boxes and fills each box with a letter from a - j.

Each turn the player can open one box and the content will be printed to the screen and stay there for 5 seconds. After that the screen will be cleared and the player may open another box. In case the player gets two consecutive boxes with the same letter, these two boxes will be removed from the game.

The player may open up to 40 boxes before the game ends.

Goal of the game is to find all the matching letter pairs and remove the boxes before the 40 guesses are used up.
